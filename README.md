# equdist

Welcome to the `equdist` repository! This project contains the code and resources necessary for implementing a Python-integrated JAX-written rigorous Newton-Raphson algorithm for equilibrium separation, with applications to distillation sequencing for purifying multi-component mixtures. This algorithm is integrated into a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to optimize process synthesis, specifically for distillation.

## Introduction

This project aims to provide an efficient and reliable method for distillation sequencing using a Newton-Raphson algorithm implemented in JAX. The primary application is to leverage reinforcement learning to optimize distillation processes, providing a scalable and flexible solution for chemical engineering tasks.

## Features

- **Rigorous Newton-Raphson Algorithm**: Implemented in JAX for fast and reliable equilibrium separation.
- **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: Uses the Jumanji library's RL framework for optimizing distillation sequences.
- **Automatic Differentiation**: Supports automatic differentiation for efficient Jacobian calculation, allowing integration of non-ideal behavior.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling ideal hydrocarbon mixtures with up to ten components.
- **Integration with Aspen Plus**: Utilizes the Aspen Plus thermodynamic database for easy extension to different mixtures.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with some required libraries. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NiklasSlager/equdist.git
    cd equdist
    ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Install Jumanji Library**: Follow the instructions to install the Jumanji library from its official documentation.

## Usage

1. **Run the Training Notebook**:
    A Jupyter notebook named `training.ipynb` is provided to run the training sessions. Open the notebook and follow the instructions to start training the RL agent.
    
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook training.ipynb
    ```

2. **Configure Parameters**: Adjust the hyperparameters and environment settings as required in the `training.ipynb` file.

3. **Run the Algorithm**:
    Execute the cells in the notebook to start the training process. The RL agent will optimize the distillation process based on the given settings.

## Project Structure

- **`equdist/`**: Main directory containing the core code for the Newton-Raphson algorithm and RL integration.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluation.
- **`data/`**: Directory for storing input data and results.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python packages required for the project.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.

## Examples

### Example: Running a Basic Training Session

```python
from equdist import RLAgent, DistillationEnv

# Initialize the environment and agent
env = DistillationEnv()
agent = RLAgent(env)

# Run training
agent.train(num_episodes=1000)
```

### Example: Running the Newton-Raphson Algorithm

```python
from equdist import NRAlgorithm

# Initialize the algorithm with desired parameters
nr_algo = NRAlgorithm(components=['A', 'B', 'C'])

# Perform separation
results = nr_algo.run()
```
