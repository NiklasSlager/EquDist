## Google JAX implementation chemical equilibrium separation
The code provides a combination of the bubble-point algorithm and Newton-Raphson algorithm following the Naphtali & Sandholm approach to simulate ideal hydrocarbon mixtures. The thermodynamic equilibrium and vapor and liquid enthalpies are calculated using the DIPPR equation set.
